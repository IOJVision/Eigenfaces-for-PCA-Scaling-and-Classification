# Eigenfaces-for-PCA-Scaling-and-Classification

# Project Title: Unsupervised Machine Learning Project: Eigenfaces for PCA Scaling and Classification
using SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree

This project is focused on performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset (Eigenfaces), which consists of several thousand collated photos of various public figures. A fetcher for the dataset is built into Scikit-Learn.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to understand and implement PCA on a high-dimensional dataset.

1. Plot the dataset: The first step of this analysis involves visualizing the dataset to understand what we're working with.

2. Implement PCA: We will use the `RandomizedPCA` estimator from the Scikit-learn library, which contains a randomized method to approximate the first \(N\) principal components much more quickly than the standard `PCA` estimator. This method is particularly useful for high-dimensional data. In this project, we will look at the first 150 components.

## Results

The detailed results and insights from the PCA are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Please refer to the notebook for a comprehensive understanding of the project outcomes.
